This game is the allegorical story of a man who lost his memory and must collect symbols to gain it again, complete memory and build his life up again. Monsters may take his fragments of memory back and make him lose his way but he can fight them.

Although this game is challenging, especially when you get enough memory fragments, this game stands out for his way to mix a 3D space and a set of 2D assets and animation. Also music combines incrementally when he get the memory, and his dark and oneiric essence makes it playable multiple times without getting bored.
